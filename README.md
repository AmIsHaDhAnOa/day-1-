1. Header and Namespace
#include <iostream>: This header file allows the program to perform input/output operations, like reading from the user and printing to the console.
using namespace std;: It lets you use standard library functions (like cin and cout) without needing to prefix them with std::.
2. Variable Declaration
Declares an integer variable N to store the number entered by the user.
3. Input Prompt
cout: Prints the message to the console asking the user to enter the value of N.
cin: Reads the user's input and stores it in the variable N.
4. Input Validation
Checks if the entered value of N is less than 1 (invalid for natural numbers).
If true:
Prints an error message: "Please enter a positive integer."
Exits the program early using return 1.
